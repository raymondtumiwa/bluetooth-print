                <p>This is an example step of the course. You can put anything in here from example codes to videos.</p>
                <p> To install the CLI you need to have installed npm which typically comes with NodeJS.To install or
                    upgrade the CLI run the following npm command:</p>
                <p>npm -g install @angular/cli</p>
                <p> To verify that the CLI has been installed correctly, open a console and run:</p>
                <p> ng version</p>
                <h3>Install dependencies</h3>
                <p>To moderate the images we'll need a few Node.js packages:</p>

                Cloud Vision API to detect inappropriate images.
                The Google Cloud Storage Client Library for Node.js: @google-cloud/storage to download and upload the
                images from Cloud Storage.
                A Node.js library allowing us to run processes: child-process-promise to run ImageMagick since the
                ImageMagick command-line tool comes pre-installed on all Functions instances.
                <p> To install these three packages into your Cloud Functions app, run the following npm install --save

                    upgrade the CLI run the following npm command:</p>
                <p>npm -g install @angular/cli</p>
                <p> To verify that the CLI has been installed correctly, open a console and run:</p>
                <p> ng version</p>
                <h3>Install dependencies</h3>
                <p>To moderate the images we'll need a few Node.js packages:</p>
                The Google Cloud Vision Client Library for Node.js: @google-cloud/vision to run the image through the
                Cloud Vision API to detect inappropriate images.
                The Google Cloud Storage Client Library for Node.js: @google-cloud/storage to download and upload the
                images from Cloud Storage.
                A Node.js library allowing us to run processes: child-process-promise to run ImageMagick since the
                ImageMagick command-line tool comes pre-installed on all Functions instances.
                <p> To install these three packages into your Cloud Functions app, run the following npm install --save
                    command. Make sure that you do this from the functions directory.</p>
                <p> npm install --save @google-cloud/vision @google-cloud/storage child-process-promise</p>
                <p> This will install the three packages locally and add them as declared dependencies in your
                    package.js file.</p>

                <p>You've built a full-fidelity, offline-capable progressive web app by leveraging the power of reusable
                    Web Components and Firebase. Why bother with a native app when you know how to do all that?!
